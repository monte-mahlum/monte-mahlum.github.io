Research assistant and master's student at the University of Minnesota. My current work is on the convergence properties of a deep learning algorithm developed by W. Lee, L. Wang, and W. Li in \[[LWL](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999124004364?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=90208f984a7d511c)\]. My academic interests include (but are not limited to) higher category theory, algebraic topology, and geometry. I am currently captivated by applications of category theory to database organization, distributed systems, and deep learning.
