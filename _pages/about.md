{% include base_path %}

I am in my fourth and final year at McGill University, receiving my BSc in mathematics with an extensive minor in physics. I am also a research assistant at the University of Minnesota where I am an incoming master's student. My academic interests include (but are not limited to) cryptography & algorithms, differential geometry & topology, representation theory, mathematical physics, and deep learning. I am particularly intrigued by fundamental physics and I have many questions regarding gauge theory and categorification---I have a lot more to learn on this front.
