{% include base_path %}

Research assistant and master's student at the University of Minnesota. My research hitherto has been focussed on the convergence properties of a deep learning algorithm developed by W. Lee, L. Wang, and W. Li in \[[LWL](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999124004364?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=90208f984a7d511c)\]. 

My industrial interests include (1) formal methods in software, infrastructure, and enterprise architecture; (2) machine learning; and (3) database systems. I am particularily fascinated by the intersection between (1) and (3). My principal aim in this domain is to responsibly modernize complex systems and accelerate the maturation of critical systems.

My academic interests include (but are not limited to) category theory, type theory, topos theory, and algebraic geometry.
