{% include base_path %}

My industry interests include (1) formal methods in software, infrastructure, and systems architecture; (2) machine learning; and (3) database systems. I am particularily fascinated by the intersection between (1) and (3). My principal aim in this domain is to responsibly modernize complex systems and accelerate the maturation of critical systems.

My academic interests include (but are not limited to) category theory, type theory, topos theory, and algebraic geometry.
