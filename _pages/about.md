{% include base_path %}

I am an undergraduate student at McGill University and a research assistant at the University of Minnesota. My interests include geometry, topology, their algebraic counterparts, mathematical physics, and numerical analysis. I am particularly intrigued by fundamental physics and I have many questions regarding gauge theory, moduli spaces, and bundle geometry---I have a lot more to learn on this front.
