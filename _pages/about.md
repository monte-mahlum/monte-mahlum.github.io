{% include base_path %}

Fourth year undergraduate student at McGill University and a research assistant at the University of Minnesota. My academic interests include (but are not limited to) differential geometry and topology, representation theory, mathematical physics, and numerical analysis. I am particularly intrigued by fundamental physics and I have many questions regarding gauge theory and categorification---I have a lot more to learn on this front.
