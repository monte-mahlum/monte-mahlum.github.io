### Fibrations Podcast
*September 2022 -*

[soundcloud.com/fibrations](https://soundcloud.com/fibrations)

The idea stemmed from my own curiosity regarding both the content and process of academic research. As an undergraduate student dreaming of a future in mathematical research, I often found myself on the websites of various McGill departments reading through the current work being done. I was surprised by the vast number of unique subfields, each professor with their own questions and methods of investigation. Naturally, much of language used was unkown to me, especially as I ventured outside of mathematics and physics into the realms of neuroscience, computer science, philosophy, etc. I became very interested in first deciphering this cryptic academic code and secondly, understanding why professors chose these seemingly arbitrary, niche questions. These two queries, along with a desire to share the answers with my fellow undergraduates, were exactly the seeds for Fibrations. 

Over the course of the fall 2022 semester, I sent out over ninety emails to McGill Professors resulting in a mere five recordingsâ€”Interesting to consider why more professors weren't interested. The first episode was released in December 2022 and after an interim abroad, I returned to Montreal in September 2023 where I proceeded to release the remaining four. An important remark is that without the help of a great friend, Elliott Dwyer, the podcast would be far less rich for he pioneered the theme song in which I contributed only to the drums :)
