It is quite easy to imagine a chain of fibrations 

$$
E_n \stackrel{p_n}{\longrightarrow}E_{n-1}\stackrel{p_{n-1}}{\longrightarrow}...\stackrel{p_{2}}{\longrightarrow}E_1\stackrel{p_1}{\longrightarrow}B
$$

but the idea becomes more interesting when one considers the case when $E_n=B$. Are there any cases in which this is realized? Can they be classified? The answer to the first question is clearly yes. The following chain is one such example

$$
S^1\stackrel{p_n}{\longrightarrow}...\stackrel{p_1}{\longrightarrow}S^1
$$

where $p_i: z\mapsto z^{m_i}$ for some $m_i\in \mathbb{Z}$. The classification of all such $S^1$ chains would begin by indentifying them with the sequences $(m_1,...,m_n)$. This example could easily be expanded by allowing for the maps $p_i$ to take on more interesting forms. Is there already a classification of all fibrations of $S^1$ over $S^1$?

Turning to principal bundles, if we have a lie group $G$ and a chain of compact subgroups $H_1 < H_2 < ... < H_n < G$, we can generate a nice chain of principle bundles:

$$G\stackrel{p_1}{\longrightarrow}G/H_1\stackrel{p_{2}}{\longrightarrow}...\stackrel{p_{n}}{\longrightarrow}G/H_n$$

Going further, one can ask if there is a $p: G\to G$ which be interpreted as a principle $H-$bundle for some $H\subset G$? The answer is probably no because the fibers must be homeomorphic to $H$ which would mean $G$ is homeomorphic to $H\times G$ if the fibration is trivial. I don't think anything would change if we pass to the locally trivial setting because we would still have the problem that for every element $g\in G$ there is a neighborhood $U_g$ such that $p^{-1}(U_g)\cong U_g \times H$ which would make no sense if $p^{-1}(U_g),U_g \subset G$. Can this dream be saved if we restrict ourselves to the case when $G$ is infinite-dimensional? Perhaps, but the author currently has no experience with such objects.

Now let's try something else, consider the base space and the group to be the same object, i.e., we have $p: E\to G$ defining a principle $G-$bundle. One initial idea would be to get $S^2$ to act on $S^3$ preserving the fibers of the Hopf map, but $S^2$ cannot be realized as a lie group so this fails. Consider instead the space of continuously differentiable functions: $C^\infty (\mathbb{R})$. Is there a subspace $H\subset C^\infty$ and a space differential operators $\{L_\psi: C^\infty \to C^\infty: \psi \in H\}$ parameterized by $H$ such that the moduli bundle 

$$L: C^\infty \to H, \textup{ by }  \phi \mapsto \psi \iff L_\psi(\phi) = 0$$ 

is preserved under convolution with $H$? 

Hopefully one day this plethora of questions will either be answered or realized as ill-posed.
