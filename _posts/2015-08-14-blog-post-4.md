It is quite easy to imagine a chain of fibrations 

$$
E_n \stackrel{p_n}{\to}E_{n-1}\stackrel{p_{n-1}}{\to}...\stackrel{p_{2}}{\to}E_1\stackrel{p_1}{\to}B
$$
but the idea becomes more interesting when one considers the case when $E_n=B$. Are there any nontrivial examples? Can they be classified? The answer to the first question is clearly yes. The following chain is one such example
$$
S^1\stackrel{p_n}{\to}...\stackrel{p_1}{\to}S^1
$$
where $p_i: z\mapsto z^{m_i}$ for some $m_i\in \mathbb{Z}$. The classification of all such $S^1$ chains would begin by indentifying them with the sequences $(m_1,...,m_n)$. This example could easily be expanded by allowing for the maps $p_i$ to take on more interesting forms.
